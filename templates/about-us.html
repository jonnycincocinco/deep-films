                    <p class="cinch">When Rob was in the 7th grade a jingle writer from Foote Cone Belding appeared at his junior high. No one knew exactly why he was there, but as he played his reel kids laughed hard enough to eject milk from their nostrils. Rob had found his calling.</p>

                    <p class="cinch">After graduating from UC Berkeley, Rob landed his first job as a copywriter at BBDO writing ads for Apple Computer. From there he joined Goodby, Berlin and Silverstein and won virtually every national and international award existence. Over the years Rob has worked at creative director- or chief creative officer-level positions at such agencies as Hill-Holliday, Ogilvy &amp; Mather, and McCann-Erickson.  With the latter he was responsible for some of Microsoft’s most successful product launches (and a dud, Windows Vista) when he served as the global creative director on the client’s billion dollar plus advertising account.</p>

                    <p class="cinch">Rob’s introduction to directing and filmmaking began when he became infatuated with the Canon 5D. This led Rob to make his own films, and quickly understand how democratized filmmaking would lead to and entirely new era of commercial storytelling. He directed – and in many cases wrote – all of the work on this site.</p>

                    <p class="cinch-more">Rob is incredibly happy to live with his family in Sausalito, California, 40 seconds from Deep’s offices.</p>
