                  <h3 class="">Rob Bagot</h3>
                  <p>In the 7th grade a jingle writer from Foote Cone Belding visited Rob’s junior high at lunchtime. He was casually dressed. Told funny stories. Showed his reel. And kids laughed milk out of their nostrils. Rob had found his calling.</p>

                  <p>After graduating from Berkeley, Rob landed his first job at BBDO writing ads for Apple computer. From here, he joined Goodby, Berlin & Silverstein where he won most every national and international advertising award. Over the last 20 years, rob has served at the creative director- or chief creative director-level at such agencies as Hill-Hollday, McCann-Erickson and Ogilvy & Mather on accounts that include IBM, Microsoft, Cisco, Coca-Cola, Toyota and McDonalds.</p>

                  <p>In the mid-2000s Rob’s infatuation with the Canon 5D camera led him to make his own films and eventually directing commercials. He directed – and in many cases wrote – most of the work on this site.</p>

                  <p>Rob is incredibly stoked to live 40 seconds from work with his family in Sausalito, California.</p>
